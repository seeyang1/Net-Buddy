# Net-Buddy, a system that will tracks network traffic from a raspberry pi and displays it to its companion app


To Do: 

~~1. get sql server up and running~~

~~2. learn how to push data to the server from the pi~~
  - ~~Have to refine packet cap to include port numbers and protocol~~

3. learn how to pull data from the server to the app 
  - ~~-set up the node.js server to pull from sql database~~

4. push and pull data to and from the server manually to test integration

5. refine scripts so that everything runs autonomously 

6. bug test and refine for final presentation
