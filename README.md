# Net-Buddy, a system that will tracks network traffic from a raspberry pi and displays it to its companion app while detecting port scans

Like the title says. this is our app that detects port scans on a network and displays and notifies users on the app. The Prerequisite is to make the pi as a wifi point. The sifting program also has the ip address of the wifi hard coded in. 

This project is now archived. This is the final state of the project at the end of our development. This project is unfinished, however.
Things that we would've liked to do had we had more time:
  1. Using the arin API for reverse lookup and geolocationing
  2. Making the Raspberry pi act as a firewall and block connections
  3. Refine the app a little bit more
     - Make the app store the times and dates of suspected port scans
  4. Refine the packet scanner further to facilitate port scanning
     - Make the sifting program take the ip address from the pi itself and not hard code the ip address in

Thank you for reading.
